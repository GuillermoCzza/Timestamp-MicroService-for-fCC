# Timestamp Microservice

Node.js application that serves a webpage when GETting the root ("/"), or the inputted date as a UNIX timestamp and as a string date (both as fields in a json) when GETting "/api/:date?/". The requested date may be a valid date string or a UNIX timestamp, and if left empty, it will default to the current time.
 
Made from freeCodeCamp's boilerplate code for the Timestamp Microservice project (https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-timestamp/).
